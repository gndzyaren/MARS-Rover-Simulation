Mars Pathfinding Simulation with AI-Optimized Algorithms

This project simulates a pathfinding algorithm designed for Mars' rugged terrain using AI-based optimization techniques. The topographic data used in the simulation is artificially generated, and AI-based algorithms like A* are applied to find the most efficient routes for exploration. 
This simulation provides insights into autonomous vehicle routing and optimization in challenging environments like Mars, and it also has potential applications in the automotive industry for pathfinding and route optimization.

üöÄ Overview
This project demonstrates the use of AI algorithms to simulate pathfinding for autonomous rovers navigating Mars' surface. 
The simulation is based on artificially generated Mars-like topographic data, not actual Mars data, and it applies AI-based algorithms (Reinforcement Learning - Q learnings) to find the most efficient routes through the terrain.
This approach also showcases how similar techniques can be applied to autonomous driving in the automotive sector.

The main objectives of this project are:

Simulating Mars terrain using artificial data generated through AI.
Implementing pathfinding algorithms to navigate the terrain.
Optimizing the route using AI techniques to learn and improve the pathfinding process.
Drawing parallels to autonomous driving in the automotive sector, especially in challenging or unknown terrains.

üßë‚Äçüíª Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used to implement the algorithms and simulation.
Matplotlib: Library used for visualizing the Mars-like terrain and the pathfinding results.
Numpy: Library used for numerical operations and handling the generated topographic data.
AI Algorithms: Primarily A* for pathfinding, and additional optimization techniques to improve route efficiency over time.

üåç Simulated Terrain
The topographic data used in this project is artificially generated through AI techniques to simulate Mars' surface. 
This allows for a flexible and controlled environment in which the pathfinding algorithm can be tested. 
Unlike real Mars data (such as MOLA), this simulation focuses on creating a simplified yet effective Mars-like terrain to demonstrate pathfinding capabilities.
